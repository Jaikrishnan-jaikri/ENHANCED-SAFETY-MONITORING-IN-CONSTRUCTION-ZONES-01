# ENHANCED-SAFETY-MONITORING-IN-CONSTRUCTION-ZONES-01


This project provides an AI-powered solution for real-time safety monitoring in construction zones. It detects safety gear violations (PPE compliance), danger zone breaches, and notifies supervisors through visual dashboards and SMS alerts.

ðŸ“Š Features

Real-time detection of:

No Hardhat

No Mask

No Safety Vest

Danger Zone Intrusion

DeepSORT-based person tracking

CLAHE-enhanced video processing for better accuracy

SMS alert system via Twilio

Web dashboard for detection log viewing

Violation summary with tracked counts per frame

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Django

OpenCV

Ultralytics YOLO

DeepSORT (deep_sort_realtime)

Twilio

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/construction-safety-monitoring.git
cd construction-safety-monitoring

Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run migrations:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Start the development server:

python manage.py runserver

ðŸš§ Model Weights

Due to file size, the YOLOv11s model (best.pt) is not included.
Download it from Google Drive and place it inside the APP/ folder.

ðŸ”§ How It Works

Web camera feed is processed in real-time.

CLAHE enhances frame contrast.

YOLO detects objects; DeepSORT assigns consistent IDs.

If a person is detected in the danger zone or violates PPE rules, a log is saved with:

Frame number

Track ID

Violation type

Timestamp

Person count

SMS is sent via Twilio if alerts are enabled.

ðŸŒŸ Violation Summary Fields

Total persons tracked

No Mask

No Hardhat

No Safety Vest

Danger Zone Intrusions


Collaborators (if any)

ðŸ”§ Future Enhancements

Crowd density monitoring

Posture-based fatigue detection

Tool and material misuse detection

Attendance with PPE compliance

Centralized cloud dashboard

ðŸŒŸ Accuracy

Model accuracy: 87.2% (YOLOv11s variant chosen after testing multiple models)
